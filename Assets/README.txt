Programming Assignment 2: A game with textures, a GUI, and a way to win

I implemented two different types of particles one that is a fire (like the one in the book) that is burning some logs in my game,
The second is right in front of you when you start the game (blue particles suronding the tree) you can see that my two particles are very 
different. 

The way you win is by reaching the finish line, you can easily accomplish this by cheating and pressing t to give you lots of time and lots of lives. 
If you die or run out of time before you reach the finish you lose.

The way I made this game fun was by giving the player the decision to immediately try to run through a mob of enemies for the fastest posible time, or take 
alternative routes such as the ramp above the player that will take longer so its harder to completed the maze before the time is up but it is safer. The game
I made is quite challenging without the cheats so I would suggest using them for grading, but this challenging part of the game is also what makes it fun, you have a very
limited amount of time and on top of that you only have 1 health, there are lots of enemies that can easily spot due to their spinning nature. If you choose to take the
enemies on there are ways you can combat them such as using the waterspell which acts like a sheild against there fireballs, if they shoot you with a fireball and you hit
the fireball with your water spell you can protect yourself. There are plenty of routes you can take to get through the maze and win. I think that makes it lots of fun and turns the game that is challenging to win in the first place
 to an almost speed runny type of game once you have it figured out, you can even go on top of some of the walls using the ramps to achieve some of the fastest times 
 however it is very difficult to stay on the walls these types of features make a game fun cause you might not notice some of the things you can do at first glance, are you going
 to go throught the enemies? Are you skilled enought to use your waterspell and block the attacks? are you going to climb the walls, options endless, endless fun.
